at pins.servoWritePin(AnalogPin.P0, -100)
+duty = 2.5%
width = 500 us
max +duty = 12.5%
width = 2.5 ms

appears to interpret all values under 0 as being 0 so the +duty does not change
the faster the written number changes the faster the +duty changes
the +duty does not change until the written number is non negative
